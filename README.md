# Santa-Monica-Parking-Map

This application shows parking availability in lots and garages owned by the City of Santa Monica, CA. I created this application to help with parking on a visit to Santa Monica Pier. It uses Leaflet and pulls data from Santa Monica's Parking Data API (https://parking.api.smgov.net). Base layers are a selection of various public-facing services from the Los Angeles County Enterprise GIS, OpenStreetMap, and Mapbox.
